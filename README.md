# BliepProject
The Bliep Project is an educational project dedicated to cloning the game Diep.io.

# Bliep.io Server
This repository is for the game server which is written in Node.js (javascript).
To connect to the server, you must use the Bliep.io Client. The original Diep.io
client will NOT WORK even if you manage to create a plugin which allows you to
connect to an ip address. This is because the BliepProject has it's own protocol
and is in a way its own game.

## Work In Progress!
This repository is still a work in progress. Check back later!

## What's working
- Connection with client
- Players moving around
- Player Names
- Shooting Bullets (although unstable and require fine tuning)

## What's not working
- Lot's of stuff but now working on: refining shooting bullets
